this program assumes that there is a folder that holds all the pictures in the same directory

it also assumes that the wind and wave spreadsheets are in the same directory

if you want to change any of the input files, or output file name, there are four variables at the top of the program file

in the output csv file, 
1. the first element in a line is the image name/path 
2. the second element is the wind speed in m/s 
3. the wind wave height is the third element in meters
4. the Beaufort force is the fourth element (currently being calculated from the wind speed only)
